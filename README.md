# HalalOps — Halal Jobs, Verified

> **Check if a job is halal before you check if it fits your CV.**
> The first job-search system for Muslims that screens every opportunity for Islamic permissibility — the employer's business, your specific role, and their complicity in oppression — with verified Quran, hadith, and fatwa citations. Only then does it run the full career evaluation: CV match, salary analysis, tailored documents, interview prep.

## Why This Was Created

A Muslim professional asking "should I take this job?" is really asking two questions, and the more important one comes first:

1. **Is this rizq halal?** — Is the employer's business permissible? Would *my* work feed something haram? Is this company supplying weapons or surveillance used against innocent people — in Gaza, East Turkestan, Kashmir, Arakan, or anywhere?
2. Only then: *does it fit my skills and pay fairly?*

Every job tool on the market answers the second question. None answer the first. Halal stock screeners exist for *investing* (Zoya, Musaffa); boycott apps exist for *shopping* (Boycat); nothing existed for the decision that shapes your entire income stream — **employment**.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> *"The halal is clear and the haram is clear, and between them are doubtful matters about which many people do not know. Whoever guards against the doubtful matters has protected his religion and his honour."*
> — Sahih Bukhari 52; Sahih Muslim 1599 ([sunnah.com/bukhari:52](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:52))

And he ﷺ warned of the man whose du'a is not answered *"while his food is haram, his drink is haram, his clothing is haram, and he has been nourished with haram"* — Sahih Muslim 1015.

HalalOps exists so that no Muslim has to choose between career tooling and their akhirah.

Plus: portal scanning with a haram pre-filter (watchlisted
weapons/surveillance companies never enter your pipeline),
batch evaluation, offer comparison, and a du'a from the
Sunnah at the end of every report.

### The integrity rules that govern everything

- **No unsourced claims.** Every verse, hadith, fatwa, company fact, watchlist flag, and salary figure carries a verifiable reference — or is explicitly labeled `[analysis — no source]`.
- **Scripture is never quoted from the model's memory.** Citations come from a pre-verified ledger or are verified live against the source APIs at evaluation time. Sahih Muslim citations carry dual numbering (Abd al-Baqi / CDN). Hadith gradings name the grading scholar (e.g. "Al-Albani: Sahih").
- **The tool reports scholarship; it never issues rulings.** Where scholars differ, all positions are presented — your madhab's first — and you are reminded of Salat al-Istikharah (Sahih Bukhari 1166).

## How To Use It

### Option A — The skill (lightest)
1. Copy `skill/halal-ops/` into your Claude Code skills directory (`~/.claude/skills/halal-ops/`) or upload it zipped to Claude.ai (Settings → Capabilities → Skills).
2. Paste any job description and say **"is this halal?"** or **"evaluate this job."**
3. First run asks your madhab (Hanafi / Shafi'i / Maliki / Hanbali / present all) — answered once, saved forever.

### Option B — The full system (this repository)
1. Clone the repo, run `npm install`, then `node doctor.mjs` to verify setup.
2. Open the folder in Claude Code — onboarding will set up your CV, profile, and tracker if missing.
3. Everything the skill does, plus zero-token portal scanning (`node scan.mjs`), PDF/LaTeX CV generation, batch evaluation, follow-up cadence tooling, and pattern analysis.

Works in your language — evaluations respond in whatever language you write in, and scripture is served from **verified translations in 44+ languages** (Bengali, Urdu, Malay, Indonesian, Turkish, Arabic, and more — including Uyghur), never machine-translated.

## Disclaimer

HalalOps presents verified scholarship as reference material — **it is not a fatwa, and it is not a mufti.** Rulings differ by situation and madhab; the system shows you the sources and the disagreements, but for your specific circumstance, consult a qualified scholar. Scholar review of the rulings library is planned before wide release.
